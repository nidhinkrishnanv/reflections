Q. When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When multiple people work on same project.
When we will be working on different systems at different locations.
When we do some work in public systems.

Q. Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

We might make changes in local repository and want to push the changes when they are done.
