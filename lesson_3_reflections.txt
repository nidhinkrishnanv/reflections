When we will be working on different systems at different locations.

Q. Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Q. Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

 Fork is used to copy someone else's repository to our github account.
 Fork is like cloning inside Github.

 Clone is used to copy from one repository to another.
 With Clone we can get someone else's or our repository from Github to local system.
 
 Branch is used to split our commits in one repository.
 Branch is used when we want to do some feature in one repository itself.
